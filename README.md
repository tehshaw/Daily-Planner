# Daily-Planner

This project was to create a daily planner for "normal" working hours of 9am to 5pm. I allows the user to enter details into a text box which, when requested, will be saved to local storage.

Hours of the day that have already past, the text areas will be shaded grey. Future hours will show as green. The current hour will show as red.

The site will create a new planner for each day while past days will remain in local. Combined with a date selector this would allow the user to save multiple days worth of details (no included in the build)
